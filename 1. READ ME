Hello! I'm a 2nd year Master's student in Neuroscience.  

I share here my Matlab code that I have done during my internship (of course with the help of my supervisor) in 
the 'Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives' in Marseille in the 'Espace' team.
I studied place cell activity in rats while they were performing a goal directed task.

The following are codes that I used for analyse my data. 

The first one (file n°2) is a time analysis of the activity of place cells when the animal across the goal zone.
To run this code it is essential to have the recordings files : "Zmoth_05032020_S1-01.uff" and "Zmoth_05032020_S1_even_flag-01.uff".

The second one (file n°3) is an analysis of cells depending of their type (place cell, grid cell or head direction cell).
It necessits several functions to run it : file 3.a, 3.b etc... are the needed functions.
This code gives figure to visualise the spatial characteristic of the cell (rate map, trajectory of the animal, wave form, auto-correlogram, grid spacing etc...).
To run this code you can use tetrode 7 and cell 2.

Enjoy !
