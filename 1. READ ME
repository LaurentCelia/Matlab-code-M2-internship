I share here my Matlab code that I have written during my internship at the 'Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives' in Marseille
in the 'Espace' team.
I studied place cell activity in rats while they were performing a goal directed task.

The following are codes that I used to analyse my data. 

The first one (file n°2) is a time analysis of the place cells activity when the animal cross the goal zone.
To run this code you can use the variables I get from my recordings : 'TTMtx.mat', 'PosMtx.mat', and 'E_FlagMtx'.
They are available at the end of all my codes. 

The second one (file n°3) is an analysis of different type of cells (place cell, grid cell or head direction cell).
It requires several functions to run it : file 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, 3.g, 3.h.
This code permits to visualise the spatial characteristics of the cell (rate map, trajectory of the animal, wave form,
auto-correlogram, grid spacing etc...).
To run this code you can use the variables I used from my recordings : 'TTMtx.mat' and 'PosMtx.mat'.
 you can use tetrode 7 and cell 2.
